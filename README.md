Important Notes:
1) The Jupyter notebook requires the PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to run.
2) I included a 'data' folder because the Jupyter notebook is directed to save the CIFAR-10 dataset there.
   Otherwise, create a folder named 'data' in whichever directory you save the Jupyter notebook.
